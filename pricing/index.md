# Account types
{: #pricing}

You can run apps in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} and try {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services for free. You can sign up for a free 30-day trial that gives you additional allowances, including free support. After 30 days, you can choose to upgrade to a different account type and pay only for what you use beyond the free allowances. Bluemix provides a cost calculator for you to estimate the cost beforehand and the Usage Dashboard view for you to check the actual cost after you build your apps.

## Signing up for a free trial account
{: #trial}
You can sign up for a free 30-day trial with your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} ID. During the trial, you can develop apps and use services on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.

Your account is provided with the following resources, free of charge:

* Maximum 2 GB memory
* 10 services
* 1 SSL certificate

Your free trial expires 30 days after you sign up, at which point the apps in your account are stopped. You can't sign up for another trial on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, but you can still access your account and the accounts that you are invited to. To restart your apps, you must either provide your credit card information for a Pay-As-You-Go account or create a Subscription account. After you convert your trial account, you can continue to use free compute and service allowances. You pay only for the usage of services, containers, and runtimes that is not included as part of your free monthly allowance.

If you do not convert your account after your free trial expires, you'll receive email notifications about your account status. The notifications remind you to create your pay account so that your app settings and configurations will not be lost. If you do not want to receive these notifications from {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, you can unsubscribe at any time.
One month after the trial expiration, your apps and service configurations are removed. The following figure shows the general process of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account management.

If you convert your account during your free trial, your free allowances are limited to allowances normally provided by each service. The allowances are no longer unlimited use allowances that are offered by many of the IBM services during the free trial.
