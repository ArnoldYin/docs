# Toolchains on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public compared to toolchains on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CIO Dedicated

{{site.data.keyword.jazzhub}} is evolving into {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_full}}. As part of that change, projects will be upgraded to toolchains.

When your project is ready to be upgraded, a message is displayed on its Overview page. You can then upgrade the project to a toolchain on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public or on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} CIO Dedicated.
