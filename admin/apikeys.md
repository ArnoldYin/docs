# Managing API keys
{: #manapikey}

An application programming interface key (API key) is code that is passed in by computer programs that call an application programming interface (API) to identify the calling program, its developer, or its user to the website. API keys are used to track and control how the API is being used, for example to prevent malicious use or abuse of the API (as defined perhaps by terms of service). The API key often acts as both a unique identifier and a secret token for authentication, and  generally has a set of access rights on the API associated with it. API keys can be based on the universally unique identifier (UUID) system to ensure they are unique to each user.

As a {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} user you might want to use an API key when you enable a program or script without distributing your password to the script. A benefit of using an API key can be that a user or organization can create several API Keys for different programs and the API keys can be deleted independently if compromised without interfering with other API keys or even the user.


You can manage your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} API keys, from the Bluemix API Keys window.  Click **Bluemix API keys** from the navigation panel to see a list of your API Keys with descriptions and dates.  You can create, edit or delte an API key:

<dl>
<dt>Create API Key</dt>
<dd>Click to assign an API key to a subject by user and service ID. Provide a name and description and then enter the location of the API key or click to search for it.</dd>
<dt>Edit name and description</dt>
<dd>From the **Actions** menu of an API key that is listed in the table, click to edit the name and description of the API key.</dd>
<dt>Delete key</dt>
<dd>From the **Actions** menu of an API key that is listed in the table, click to delete the API key.</dd>
</dl>
